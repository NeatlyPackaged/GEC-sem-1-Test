# GEC-sem-1-Test

This Repository represents the 12 weeks I have worked on my Games Engine Creation Module. I may have not completed as many programs as I wished, though that is to be a problem thanks to my other modules taking as much effort to complete.

For the future of this module, I will attempt to improve on separating my modules more and I will also spend more time and effort working on my other programs even if I struggle and even if do not have to work on them for my assignment submission because I can learn a lot more with these programs.
